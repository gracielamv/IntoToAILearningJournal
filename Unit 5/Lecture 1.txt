What hardware is required to run AI?
GPU
What is hardware?
Motherboard:
	The most important piece of hardware, distributes communication between all the hardware components.
CPU (Central Processing Unit):
	Uses binary code (1's and 0's) Physical if statements. It computes and multitasks - multiple smaller tasks, arithmetic and logical problems
PCIe Lanes:
	(Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) Transmits and receives data from other components to the motherboard
	Laptop has 8, desktop 16, servers have 100s
Network Cord: Supports and provides faster networking, better wifi.
GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
	Started out as only rendering graphics and video. Does all the things CPU doesn't want to, able to do linear tasks very quickly.
Power supply: Converts power supply for computer, turns energy into heat
RAM (Random Access Memory):
	Most recent data is stored in here - fast and volatile storage. 
	Short-term memory
ECC (Error Correction Code) Memory:
	Built in error-detecting and repair features, identifies mistakes and lowers the chances of data corruption in transmission
	Non-ECC is cheaper, depends only on error detection, mistakes are more likely to pass through, corruption in data
Storage: SATA (Serial AT Attachment), Hard Disk Drive (HDD), NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)

OS
Debian - oldest Linux os, can run on any hardware

Important commands to know in Linux:
mkdir - makes a directory in a file system, many ways to use this
cd - changes directory back one (or to parent directory?)
nano - command line text editor

VM (virtual machine) -> VirtualBox, https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
