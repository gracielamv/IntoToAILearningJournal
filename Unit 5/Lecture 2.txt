Lecture 2
Virtualization Explained

Virtualization - tools to virtualize to use it on another computers
used to cut a big machine into smaller pieces/machines

Hypervisors
	Type 1/BM - installed directly on top of the host system, most secure, lower latency
	Type 2/Hosted - layer of host os on top of the host system, less frequent, higher latency, extra steps

Virtual Machines are softwares in "containers" that can't speak to each other (connect to the others folders/data) because they're independent and believe they're their own machine/os. Portable

Lecture 2.5?
