AI MULTIMEDIA
	Media (images, video, audio) that is either generated or altered by AI

TTS (Text-to-speech):
	Technically started since the 18th century but electrical synthetic speech has been around since the 1930's
	Use clear, correctly punctuated, speech to get the output you want
Voice cloning:
	Using an audio sample to then make it sounds like the original
	Include tone, pacing, and consider the audience when using this

Video generation:
	The youngest/newest technology right now; can be very expensive to create
	Text to video - (simple) prompting AI to create AI
		Have to use cinematic terms, the style of video, again giving it a persona
	Image to video - image used as a reference / starting point, can use a text prompt to move
