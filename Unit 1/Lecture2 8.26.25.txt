AI Terms

An algorithm is just an mathematical formula, an output of an algorithm can always be determined while an AI in non deterministic
Bias, computers themselves are not biased but they are programmed by humans who are biased
	AI is biased because of the people behind it
AI needs a large amount of data
Black box, you know the input and you know the output but not how it works

You can use any language for AI, but the most "popular" is Python

Context window: the maximum number of snapshots that AI can process and use
Emergent behavior: 
Generative AI:
Hallucination: kind of personifying AI, inaccurate or illogical answers due to data
LLM (Large Language Model): Works by forecasting word sequences, evolving with frequent use
Meta prompt/ system prompt:
Prompt Engineering: The practice of making the prompts better, guiding an AI's output
Temperature (AI Temperature): Defines how quirky the output can be (less likely to pick a word)

Tokenizer: Words make up tokens - 4 characters per token usually in open ai. 
	Common sequences of characters found in a set of text.  
	When using very expensive AI's you pay per token
	Input is cheap, output is more expensive (also done in tokens)
a very expensive autocomplete...
AI guesses the next word
