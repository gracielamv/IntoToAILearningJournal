Docker (Software)
You want your apps to be able to run on different operating software
	host machine
	docker container

Containers vs VMs what's the difference?
	Containers are built on top of the host os - running applications
		Can be lightweight
	Virtual machines run operating systems
	Both are isolated

Immutable: no access to the os, can't be changed/altered
Mutable: Full access to the os, can be changed, more flexible

Containerization: AWS definition "software deployment process that bundles an application's code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure"
