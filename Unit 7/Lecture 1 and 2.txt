Lecture 1
Article: Market analyst says the AI bubble is 17x bigger than the dotcom goldrush and 4x larger than the subprime bubble that caused the 2008 crash
	Those dotcom and subprime bubble are (were?) also known as the y2k bubbles
	Stocks were inflated in late 90s and early 2000s because the internet/web was the this big new thing
	Same thing happening with AI right now; everything has and uses AI
	The people running the AI models are the ones getting a lot of money

I feel like the AI bubble is just as (if not more) likely to pop as the y2k bubble (or maybe it'll just decrease, I'm not a market analyst)
