Prompt engineering - guiding ai to generate desired outputs
how to get the ai to do what you want
	Requires steps, to output high quality
	how to make a better prompt
Better control of the output, better user experiences, decrease cost

You're holding it wrong - ai/tech industry
	You can make a better prompt but Ai is just wrong most of the time

AI framework - google recommended:
	Task: persona (who the AI is), format (output type)
	Context: Good: give me some ideas for a birthday present. Under $30. Great: Give me 5 ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is for a 29-yo who loves winter sports. And has recently switched to a snowboarding from skiing.
Input is way cheaper than the output - reducing the output in your input
	Reference: Additional input data, ideas
	> Evaluate the output
	> Iterate - fix the errors, back to task
Using AI for coding/website/summarization - breaking down the task into multiple diff steps. Larger prompt into smaller prompts might take longer and be more expensive. Better output
Ai gets stuck in a loop sometimes
	Write a marketing plan - also works
	vs
	Write a story about how this products fits into the lives of our target customer demographic - diff tone
Better prompts - implement constraints
